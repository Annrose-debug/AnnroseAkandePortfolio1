            <h2>To-do List Website</h2>
            <p>
              This To-Do List web application allows users to add, edit, delete,
              and organize tasks efficiently. It was built with a strong focus
              on simplicity, usability, and clean UI design to ensure a smooth
              and intuitive user experience. The application supports dynamic
              task management through effective DOM manipulation and event
              handling. During this project, I strengthened my understanding of
              JavaScript fundamentals, including handling user interactions,
              managing application state, and working with local storage to
              persist tasks even after the page is refreshed. The project also
              incorporates smooth animations and responsive design principles,
              making it accessible and visually appealing across different
              screen sizes. Overall, this project reflects my ability to build
              functional, user-friendly web applications while paying attention
              to performance, usability, and modern front-end development best
              practices.

            <h2>WeatherNow Web Application</h2>
            <p>
              WeatherNow is a responsive web application that provides users
              with real-time weather information for any city. The app allows
              users to search for locations and instantly view key weather
              details such as temperature, weather conditions, humidity, and
              wind speed. It was designed with a clean and user-friendly
              interface to make checking the weather quick and intuitive. This
              project helped me gain hands-on experience working with APIs,
              including fetching and handling external data asynchronously using
              JavaScript. I improved my understanding of API integration, error
              handling, and dynamic content rendering based on user input. The
              application also focuses on responsive design, ensuring a smooth
              experience across both desktop and mobile devices. Overall,
              Weather Now demonstrates my ability to build practical, real-world
              web applications that interact with external services while
              maintaining a clear, modern UI and good performance.

            <h2>Personal Portfolio</h2>

              This personal portfolio website was designed and developed to
              showcase my skills, projects, and growth as a frontend developer.
              It serves as a central platform where visitors can explore my
              work, learn more about my background, and view the projects I have

              my understanding of responsive web design, layout structuring, and
              component-based thinking. I focused on creating a smooth and
              engaging interface with subtle animations and interactive elements
              to enhance usability without overwhelming the user. The site is
              fully responsive, ensuring consistent performance across different

              GlowUp is a responsive landing page created for a modern skincare
              brand, designed with a clean, elegant aesthetic and a strong focus
              on visual appeal and user experience. The page showcases skincare
              products, brand values, and key benefits in a clear and engaging
              way, guiding users naturally through the content with
              well-structured sections and strong call-to-action elements. This
              project allowed me to apply and strengthen my skills in responsive

            <h2>Expense Tracker Web Application</h2>
            <p>
              The Expense Tracker is a responsive web application designed to
              help users track and manage their daily expenses in a simple and
              organized way. Users can add, view, and delete expenses while
              seeing a clear breakdown of their spending. The interface focuses
              on clarity and ease of use, allowing users to quickly understand
              their financial activity at a glance. This project helped me
              strengthen my understanding of JavaScript logic, state management,
              and DOM manipulation. I worked with user input handling, dynamic
              rendering of expense lists, and calculations such as total
              expenses. Local storage was implemented to persist data, ensuring
              that expenses remain saved even after the page is refreshed.
              Through this project, I gained practical experience building a
              real-world application that combines functionality with clean UI
              design. The Expense Tracker demonstrates my ability to create
              interactive, user-focused web applications while applying best
              practices in responsiveness, usability, and code organization.
